## Datta Source and cleaning

This data was provided by the City of New York(see link below for additional information), This data has been reduced to only contain information pertaining to FPM(fine particulate mater) with the goal of discovering where and when the most quantities can be found in NYC.

## Findings 
Over 12 micro grams per cubic meter or "Âµg/m3" is considered harmful levels of FPM
FPM is most commonly caused by the burning of carbon based fuel such as fossil fuels or bio matter.  
The most FPM can be found in Midtown(CD5)
```{r areas}
plot(area_viz)
```

## Seasons
Though the concentration season to season is relatively similar there is a slightly greater concentration of FPM in the winter.
```{r season}
plot(season_viz)
```

## Over Time
Fortunately over the past few years the average concentration of FPM has been decreasing. 
```{r years}
plot(year_viz)
```
